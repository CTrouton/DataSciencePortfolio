# Prediction of Stroke Patients

# Executive Summary #
This stroke prediction dataset analysis will follow the CRISP-DM modelling. (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining).

##### Business understanding
* This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on variables like age, gender, various diseases, and smoking status. The healthcare sector use data analytics to improve patient health by detecting diseases before they happen. For the purpose of this project, I provide findings and recommendations as if they were to be used by the healthcare sector due to the data sourced from Kaggle.

*Hypothesis: Age, hypertension and smoking habits are significant predictors influecing the likelihood of experiencing a stroke among adults'*
##### Data processing, understanding and preperation
* The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle and loaded into Jupyter. Records are checked to understand fields and values and examined to identify relationships. The dataset is validated and cleansed using Jupter. Columns are renamed for ease for analysis and modelling.

##### Modelling
* The dataset is reviewed and a decision is made which algorithms to try. Models are built and assessed.
  
##### Evaluation and Deployment
* The dataset is reviewed and evaluated and a model is decided which is best to meet the business need. The process is reviewed, findings are summarised and a final report is produced. Advantages and disadvantages are given of the project.
